        <h1>Produced by Sumant Chaganti</h1>
        <h3>Vera or, The Nihilists</h3>
        <h4>99 Rue Tchernavaya, Moscow. A large garret lit by oil lamps
            hung from ceiling. Some masked men standing silent and apart from one
            another. A man in a scarlet mask is writing at a table. Door at back.
            Man in yellow with drawn sword at it. Knocks heard. Figures in cloaks
            and masks enter._</h4>
        <p>
            <h4>MICHAEL</h4>. <p>To strangle whatever nature is in us; neither to love nor to be
loved, neither to pity nor to be pitied, neither to marry nor to be
given in marriage, till the end is come; to stab secretly by night; to
drop poison in the glass; to set father against son, and husband against
wife; without fear, without hope, without future, to suffer, to
annihilate, to revenge.</p>

<h4>PRES</h4>. <p>Are we all agreed?</p>

<h4>CONSPIRATORS</h4>. <p>We are all agreed. (_They disperse in various directions
about the stage._)</p>

<h4>PRES</h4>. <p>'Tis after the hour, Michael, and she is not yet here.</p>

<h4>MICH</h4>. <p>Would that she were! We can do little without her.</p>

<h4>ALEXIS</h4>. <p>She cannot have been seized, President? but the police are on
her track, I know.</p>

<h4>MICH</h4>. <p>You always seem to know a good deal about the movements of the
police in Moscow--too much for an honest conspirator.</p>

<h4>PRES</h4>. <p>If those dogs have caught her, [3]the red flag of the people will
float on a barricade in[3] every street till we find her! It was foolish
of her to go to the Grand Duke's ball. I told her so, but she said she
wanted to see the Czar and all his cursed brood face to face once.</p>

<h4>ALEXIS</h4>. <p>Gone to the State ball?</p>

<h4>MICH</h4>. <p>I have no fear. She is as hard to capture as a she-wolf is, and
twice as dangerous; besides, she is well disguised. But is there any
news from the Palace to-night, President? What is that bloody[4] despot
doing now besides torturing his only son? Have any of you seen him? One
hears strange stories about him. They say he loves the people; but a
king's son never does that. You cannot breed them like that.</p>

<h4>PRES</h4>. <p>Since he came back from abroad a year ago his father has kept him
in close prison in his palace.</p>

<h4>MICH</h4>. <p>An excellent training to make him a tyrant in his turn; but is
there any news, I say?</p>

<h4>PRES</h4>. <p>A council is to be held to-morrow, at four o'clock, on some secret
business the spies cannot find out.</p>

<h4>MICH</h4>. <p>A council in a king's palace is sure to be about some bloody work
or other. But in what room is this council to be held?</p>

<h4>PRES</h4>. <p>(_reading from letter_). In the yellow tapestry room called after
the Empress Catherine.</p>

<h4>MICH</h4>. <p>I care not for such long-sounding names. I would know where it is.</p>

<h4>PRES</h4>. <p>I cannot tell, Michael. I know more about the insides of prisons
than of palaces.</p>

<h4>MICH</h4>. <p>(_speaking suddenly to ALEXIS_). Where is this room, Alexis?</p>

<h4>ALEXIS</h4>. <p>It is on the first floor, looking out on to the inner courtyard.
But why do you ask, Michael?</p>

<h4>MICH</h4>. <p>Nothing, nothing, boy! I merely take a great interest in the
Czar's life and movements, and I knew you could tell me all about the
palace. Every poor student of medicine in Moscow knows all about king's
houses. It is their duty, is it not?</p>

<h4>ALEXIS</h4> <p>(_aside_). Can Michael suspect me? There is something strange in
his manner to-night. Why doesn't she come? The whole fire of revolution
seems fallen into dull ashes when she is not here.</p>

<h4>[5]MICH</h4>. <p>Have you cured many patients lately, at your hospital, boy?</p>

<h4>ALEX</h4>. <p>There is one who lies sick to death I would fain cure, but cannot.</p>

<h4>MICH</h4>. <p>Ay, and who is that?</p>

<h4>ALEX</h4>. <p>Russia, our mother.</p>

<h4>MICH</h4>. <p>The curing of Russia is surgeon's business, and must be done by
the knife. I like not your method of medicine.[5]</p>

<h4>PRES</h4>. <p>Professor, we have read the proofs of your last article; it is
very good indeed.</p>

<h4>MICH</h4>. <p>What is it about, Professor?</p>

<h4>PROFESSOR</h4>. <p>The subject, my good brother, is assassination considered as
a method of political reform.</p>

<h4>MICH</h4>. <p>I think little of pen and ink in revolutions. One dagger will do
more than a hundred epigrams. Still, let us read this scholar's last
production. Give it to me. I will read it myself.</p>

<h4>PROF</h4>. <p>Brother, you never mind your stops; let Alexis read it.</p>

<h4>MICH</h4>. <p>Ay! he is as tripping of speech as if he were some young
aristocrat; but for my own part I care not for the stops so that the
sense be plain.</p>

<h4>ALEX</h4>. <p>(_reading_). "The past has belonged to the tyrant, and he has
defiled it; ours is the future, and we shall make it holy." Ay! let us
make the future holy; let there be one revolution at least which is not
bred in crime, nurtured in murder!</p>
